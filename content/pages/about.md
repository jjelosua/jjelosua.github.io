Slug: about

I am a Spanish Telecommunications engineer with broad experience in tech consultancy and financial services IT. 

In 2011, I discovered data journalism and became a data addict freelance developer. I love turning data upside down and inside out, trying to extract knowledge out of it. More comfortable with backend tasks, but also a big [D3](http://d3js.org/) fan, which I have used to create some nice interactive visualizations.

In Spain we did not have a "freedom of information access" law until December 2014, so I have been writing scraper scripts to unlock government data for a while, in order to make the information available in a more comprehensive format to citizens. To do so I enjoy working with Python (_Requests and Beautifulsoup_), Ruby (_Mechanize and Nokogiri_) and recently with _Phamtomjs_ to work around ajax sites.

I have also trained journalists in Spain and abroad in tools that allow them to find stories and work more efficiently in their data related projects. 

I strongly believe that open data, transparency and accountability will play a key role in shaping the future of modern societies. 

When not around my computer you can find me travelling, having a looong conversation with friends or swimming in the ocean.

2015 is going to be a great year!! I was selected as a 2015 Knight-Mozilla fellow ( check out the program [here](http://opennews.org/what/fellowships/)). I will join [La Nacion Data Team](https://twitter.com/lndata) to work on cool data journalism projects.

This blog has been set up to share my experience throughout this year, please feel free to contact me through social media or by [email](mailto:juan.elosua@gmail.com)
