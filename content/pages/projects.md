Selection of the projects that I have worked on over the past couple of years. In most of them I have worked with [civio](http://civio.es), an spanish non-profit that promotes transparency, accountability and free access to public data to fight for a stronger democracy and empower citizens to have a more proactive role in modern society.

## España en Llamas (Spanish)

### Description
First Data Journalism project that I have worked on (Hooray!!!). It started with a FOIA request to the spanish government to release the data for every individual forest fires that had occur in Spain from 2001 onwards.

After many data wrangling tasks, we achieved a clean database with all the geolocated forest fires with all the available metadata for each one of them. We then created a site that covers some interesting stories we found in the data as well as an interactive map that allows readers to focus on the fires that are more keen to them.

### Technologies
* Backend: _GIS related tools to transform coordinates, DB transformations_
* Frontend: _Google Maps API & D3.js for the interactive map_
