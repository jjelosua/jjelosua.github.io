Juan Elosua personal blog
=========================

Source content for the [pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com) project that
I am using to create my personal blog

Huge thanks to _pelican team_, _[DandyDev](https://github.com/DandyDev/pelican-bootstrap3)_ and _[davisp](https://github.com/davisp/ghp-import)_ for their great work that makes this blog so straight forward to build.

## Plugins repo

The configuration file asumes that you have cloned the [pelican plugins repo](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins) in a folder that lives next to this repo folder.
